### Agile Planning

This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering small features in incremental sprints. There were 3 sprints in total, spaced out evenly over three weeks.

All stories were assigned to epics, prioritized under the labels, Must have, should have, could have and assigned to sprints. "Must have" stories were completed first, "should haves" and then finally "could haves".
The Kanban board was created using github projects and can be located [TO DO](Git hub board link TO DO) and can be viewed to see more information on the project cards.Only user stories have acceptance critieria to define the certain excecution.
